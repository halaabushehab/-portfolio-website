# I made a creative portfolio for the UI Designer and Developers which has Five creative pages including Home, Works, Case Study, Blog, and Contact.
I created a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS. I designed it from scratch, creating both wireframes and mockups to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing layout.
